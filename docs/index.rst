Welcome to cookiecutter-research-template's documentation!
==========================================================

This repository lays out the structure for a reproducible research project
based on the Waf framework.

It is derived from https://github.com/hmgaudecker/econ-project-template and the
authors of this project deserve all the credit for the implementation of Waf as
a framework for reproducible research. My contribution is to add several
helpers around the project which are common in software engineering and should
help researchers to write better code.
